Inspired by Jeremy Keith's [post on implementing Dark Mode on the web](https://adactio.com/journal/15941), I set it up on my blog.
It's really easy!

The diff [nearly fits on one screen](https://github.com/mattdsteele/steele.blue/commit/18ee028de01b96508962360d03cb5588f7181de9); most of which is converting colors over to CSS custom properties. Once that's configured, Dark Mode is easy as pi:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --primary-color: #efefef;
    --secondary-color: #1a1a21;
    --link-color: #1f8dba;
  }
```

I'm developing on Windows these days, which has supported Dark Mode for a while. So testing it out was pretty easy:
