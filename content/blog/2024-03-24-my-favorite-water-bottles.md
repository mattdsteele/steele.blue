title: My favorite water bottles

![A collection of water bottles](/content/images/2024-water-bottles/bottles.jpg)

Inspired by "my favorite mugs" posts from [Cassey](https://www.cassey.dev/favorite-mugs/) and [Benji](https://www.benji.dog/articles/my-favorite-mugs/), here's a few of my favorite drinkware.
While I do have a set of mugs I love, I probably get more use out of my water bottles.
They pull double-duty as a convenient vessel for daily drinking, and for any activities on a bike.

I've raced [Gravel Worlds](https://www.gravel-worlds.com/) a half dozen times, and get a new bottle every year.
It's both functional (at 24oz, it's a decent size to throw on a bike) and stylish, and a mainstay of my bottle collection.

[Liter-sized bottles](https://www.elite-it.com/en/products/water-bottles/sport/fly-mtb) are a mainstay of my gravel races.
The extra few ounces have kept me from having to carry a hydration pack, and let me make full use of the two bottle cages on my bike.
I especially like these ones from Elite with a protective cap, which helps keep the lid free from gravel dust.
I've eaten enough dirt through the years!

Runner-up: the [Zefal Magnum](https://www.zefal.com/en/bottles/545-magnum.html) 1L bottles have traveled the most miles on my bike.

This one's substantially smaller and doesn't actually get on the bike frequently, but it makes me smile every time I break it out.
I don't buy many products from [meme influencers](https://thrillpool.com/), but I make an exception for an especially good Simpsons reference.
It makes me want to [conquer the Murderhorn](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Powersauce), even when I fill it with apple cores and Chinese newspapers.

## Postscript - Bottle Longevity

One endless conversation that I've never heard a satisfactory answer is bottle longevity.
Advice is all over the place, from "replace your bottles every season" to "use them until mold is visible and unremovable".

I tend to be pragmatic; I'll give them a good cleaning with soap and a bottle brush, and they'll be good for years.
If I start to notice a funk/aftertaste, they'll get replaced.
This is probably more psychological than scientific; most of the advocacy I've seen around microplastics, etc. tend to be from the same groups that are focused on trends and style, not sustainability.
